#Enhancing Computation and Information Science Learning Opportunities for Women Leaders in STEM

Through a generous $4.9M grant from the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, AAC&U has launched its newest STEM initiative, Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in STEM (TIDES). The overall goal of the initiative is to increase the learning outcomes and retention of students historically underrepresented in the computer/information sciences and related STEM disciplines.  

It has become critical that STEM higher education reform efforts broaden the participation of women and underrepresented minorities, who not only represent a rich source of talent, but are also the fastest growing populations in undergraduate higher education.Recent data have identified that the most advanced mechanism for broadening the participation, retention and graduation of underrepresented groups in the STEM fields is not just significant pedagogical reform, but pedagogical reform that is culturally sensitive to the lived experiences of these populations. 

Bryn Mawr College was awarded funding to build computational modules for the physical sciences for use in major's curriculum that will enhance underrepresented STEM student interest and to develop materials to support faculty in their adoption of culturally sensitive pedagogies needed to sustain the necessary changes in practice required for relevant and inclusive STEM teaching.

#Materials for Computational Learning in Physics

Learning Modules are in the pdf folder, and the related IPython notebooks are in the notebooks folder. Please feel free to download and use any of our materials. A good starting place is the Module Dependency Tree which displays how the modules are sequenced. 

If you do use the materials, we have two requests. 

First, please fill out and return to emcccorma@brynmawr.edu the "Module User Feedback Form" in the pdf folder. We'd deeply appreciate it, as will our funders!

Second, please open and read the document [INTRODUCTION to the Modules](https://github.com/BrynMawrCollege/TIDES/raw/master/pdf/INTRODUCTION_to_the_Modules.pdf). It gives an overview of the project and the documents provided here. An important part of the project has been to use pedagogical approaches that encourage and support the success of students with diverse backgrounds and experience of computation.  Toward that end we have created and provide here, resources for conducting a Faculty Workshop on Increasing Diversity and Equity in STEM on your own campus.
