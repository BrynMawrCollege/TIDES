# TIDES materials for Physics and Computation

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/BrynMawrCollege/TIDES)

Please feel free to download and use our materials. Note the Module Dependency Tree which displays how the modules are sequenced. There are only two caveats.  

First, if you use them in any way please fill out and return to emcccorma@brynmawr.edu the "Module User Feedback Form" in the pdf folder.  We'd deeply appreciate it as will our funders!

Second, please open and read the document [INTRODUCTION to the Modules](https://github.com/BrynMawrCollege/TIDES/raw/master/pdf/INTRODUCTION_to_the_Modules.pdf). It gives an overview of the projects and documents provided here. An important part of the project has been to use pedagogical approaches that encourage and support the success of students with diverse experience of computation.  Toward that end we have created and provide here materials for a Faculty Workshop on Increasing Diversity and Equity in STEM.
