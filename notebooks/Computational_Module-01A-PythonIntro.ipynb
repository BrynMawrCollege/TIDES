So, it's sufficient to do those things just once in a notebook.  (One exception is the declaration of `matplotlib` as inline: if you do this somewhere other than the beginning of the notebook, it's possible that IPython will not know about it everywhere in the notebook.  Therefore, if you anticipate doing any plotting in a notebook it's a good idea to set up `matplotlib` in the first code cell, or not far below the first.)  The same comment applies to user-defined functions: once defined in a code cell that's been executed, user-defined functions are available elsewhere in the notebook."

Remember that when you run code, you usually \"call\" standard Python functions or functions from various libraries; those, in turn, often call other functions, leading to a long chain of function calls associated with the running of your code.  When an error is reported to you, the sequence of function calls shown in Jupyterhub appears in order -- your code containing the source of the error will appear at the *bottom* of the sequence; above that will be any immediate function that called your code, and above that will be the earlier functions called in the chain of function calls.

    "If we look at the bottom of the output, we see the error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'plot'`.   The meaning of this message is not critical here, but note that it's arising in the line shown by the longer (lower) arrow, where our function calls the matplotlib library function `ax.plot(x, sqrt(x))`.  Above that section of the error message is another section containing a shorter arrow pointing to the line `plot_sqrt()` at the bottom of the cell, which is the line at the bottom of the cell where we called our function, which called `ax.plot(x, sqrt(x))`.  So, to recap, the error message shows us that the error itself was in the line `ax.plot(x, sqrt(x))`, but that line was called by the function `plot_sqrt()` that we created, so that sequence of function calls (first to `plot_sqrt`, then to `ax.plot`) is what the debugger gives us.  Generally, we care only about the last section of the message -- the location of the original error.\n",

    "* Python can be used as a calculator.  (Remember to use `**` rather than `^` to raise to a power.)  More advanced math functions can be found in the `math` and `numpy` libraries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Python has several different types of quantities for storing information, including integers, floats, characters, strings, and lists.  A variable of one type can be changed to another by \"typecasting.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Formatting strings can be used to fine tune the output of `print` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* List elements are enclosed in square brackets, \\[ \\].  List indices start at 0, and elements can be selected by \"slicing\" the list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* The Boolean values `True` and `False` result from comparing two quantities.  They also can be used to test values, e.g. in `if` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arguments to functions, e.g. the print function, are enclosed in parentheses ( ).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Python has two types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.  Use a `for` loop when you know how many repetitions you want the loop to run through.  Use a `while` loop when the number of repetitions depends on some condition being met.  (Make sure to initialize and increment the counter for a `while` loop.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "* When code has to do different things depending on different conditions, you can use `if-elif-else` statements."
