    "This module considers various versions of a familiar physical example -- projectile motion -- and how it might be studied **numerically**; i.e., by computer.  Such motion is described formally by differential equations, for which there are standard and sophisticated numerical solution techniques that will be explored in a later module.  As a gentler introduction to numerical methods, in this chapter we present a simple approach to numerically solving **ordinary differential equations**.  This method will not give the most accurate results in general, but the basic idea underlies more advanced methods, and it will get you \"warmed up\" for the techniques you will see in later modules."

    "**Jean Bartik** was born (as Betty Jean Jennings) in Gentry County, Missouri, in 1924. She received a B.S. in mathematics from Northwest Missouri State Teachers College in 1945, a GED (master's) in English from the University of Pennsylvania in 1967, and an honorary D. Sc. from Northwest Missouri State University in 2002.  Upon her graduation in 1945, she was hired to compute ballistic firing tables for the U.S. Army.  These tables were computations of projectile paths used by gunners to set their guns to hit their targets.  She was one of hundreds of human \"computers,\" usually women, who calculated these tables by hand using mechanical calculators.  Also in 1945, ENIAC -- the first electronic computer -- was completed at the University of Pennsylvania, and used for the computation of firing tables.  Bartik was one of six human computers chosen to work on the new machine.  She and the team learned to operate ENIAC and became its and, arguably, the world's first programmers.  In 1947, Bartik became part of a group that converted ENIAC into a stored-program computer, which improved its efficiency and usefulness.  Bartik also contributed to the early BINAC and UNIVAC 1 computers.  [Information and image from the Computer History Museum, http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/bios/Jean,Bartik/. For a sense of the large number of factors involved in computing firing tables, see e.g.,   http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/6-40/Ch7.htm .  For interesting information on the early mechanical and electronic calculating machines used to compute firing tables, and on the women who used them, see the Educational Materials link at  http://topsecretrosies.com/ .]"

    "Let's start by modeling simple one-dimensional (1-D) motion with constant acceleration, $a$, and without resistance.  Such motion is described by two variables that are functions of time $t$: position $x(t)$ and velocity $v(t)$.

(The line labeled \"Slope at $t + h/2$\" represents the key to a more accurate approximation which will be presented in a later Module.)  \n",

    "It turns out that the accuracy of the Euler method can be significantly improved by making a small change: instead of updating the position first and the velocity second, the velocity is updated first, and the position then is updated using the *new* velocity.  That is, the equations used are:\n",

    "These modified equations embody the ***Euler-Cromer method*** (which sometimes goes by other names).  Note that this approach amounts to using the slope at the later time, rather than the one at the earlier time, to extrapolate the position at the later time.  The Euler-Cromer method does a much better job of conserving energy than does the Euler method, which often causes the energy to increase steadily.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Eqs. (3) and (4) to evolve the position over time, starting from some initial position and velocity.  We put in the current position and velocity on the right-hand sides of the equations, compute the new values of those variables on the left-hand sides, then use those new values in the right-hand sides to get the next set of new values on the left, and so on.  This approach to solving differential equations exemplifies the process of ***iteration*** -- the output of one step of a process serves as the input for the next step.  It also is an example of a ***finite-difference*** method of solving differential equations, since it involves small but finite increments of a key parameter ($t$ here).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we present the code to compute the motion, we introduce a tool that bridges the gap between the mathematical description of a problem and the computer code that implements the solution.  That tool is ***pseudocode*** -- a programming language-independent description of how the code will be structured.  While writing pseudocode before actually coding is not necessary for simple computational problems, it becomes increasingly useful as the complexity of the problem and the associated code grow.  The problem we're considering here may not require pseudocode, but it's probably helpful to first encounter it in such a simple example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no standard syntax for pseudocode, and its form can vary depending on the programming language one is modeling with it, but here's an example of the sort of pseudocode one might write to describe what we need to do to solve the problem of one-dimensional motion without drag.

The middle set of lines creates and initializes lists that will be used to store the sequence of times at which the position and velocity are computed, as well as the corresponding values of those variables.  The lists at first contain just the initial values of the variables.  (It's possible, and sometimes desirable, to create a list without providing any initial values to it.  The syntax for that is `mylist = []`.)  Note that the various parameters and variables are given names that represent the corresponding quantities.

A `while` statement checks whether the indicated condition is met; if so, the loop is executed; if not, the program jumps to the first non-indented line following the `while` block.  (We use a `while` loop rather than a `for` loop here because we don't know ahead of time how many cycles through the loop we need to make, but we do know the stopping condition -- the final time.)  Note that the `while` condition here is written as `t <= tf - dt` (`dt` is playing the role of $\\Delta t$ in the earlier equations).  This condition is *not* checking whether the time `t` is less than or equal to the final time `tf`, but whether it's less than or equal to the *earlier* time, `tf - dt`.  That's because the `while` loop is going to calculate the variable values at the *next* time step.  If the condition were `t <= tf`, then when `t` became equal to `tf` and the program entered the loop, the loop would then calculate the variable values at `tf + dt`, which would be beyond the desired range.  \n",

To run it from the Python command line prompt, type the file name.  (The directory containing the file must be in your Python \"path\" variable.  If it's not, you will need to type the entire directory path of the file to identify it to Python; e.g. `python C:\\Users\\Anya\\Documents\\file.py`.)  To run it in an IPython notebook, you would type or copy the code, or sections of it, into executable cells in the notebook, and then run the cells in order, or else run the entire notebook.  There is no single protocol for how many lines of code should be placed in one notebook cell, but all the lines of a loop and all the lines of a user-defined function must be in one cell.  A reasonable approach might be for contiguous code lines of similar character (e.g., those initializing parameters, or those defining lists) to be put into a single cell.  "

Modify the code above to work in this situation where the gravitational force on a mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from Earth's center is $F = G m M_E / r^2$.  How does the peak height compare to the case of constant $g$ if the initial velocity is $200$ m/s?  What if it's $2200$ m/s? (This is $20\\%$ of escape velocity.)

Newton's second law in the form $F = dp/dt$ implies that $m \\, dv/dt = V \\, \\left| dm/dt \\right| - g$, where $v$ is the rocket's speed, $m$ is its mass, and $V$ is the relative speed between the rocket and its exhaust.  This latter quantity normally is incorporated in the related *specific impulse*, $\\tau_s = V/g$ (with units of time).  (a) Use your new program to compute the height as a function of time of a Saturn V rocket (used to launch the Apollo missions) during the firing of its first-stage engines (these rockets consisted of three stages in total).  The Saturn V had a total mass at liftoff of $2,810,000$ kg.  The first stage used $2,080,000$ kg of fuel (note that this is most of the mass!), with a specific impulse of $263$ sec, and burned it all in $160$ seconds.  (b) Plot the height of the rocket as a function of time for the 160-second period, assuming that it flies straight up.  (c) Also, determine the rocket's speed at the $160$-sec mark.  By the end of first-stage burn, the actual Saturn V rose to a height of $67$ km while traveling $93$ km downrange, and achieved a speed of roughly $2300$ m/s.
