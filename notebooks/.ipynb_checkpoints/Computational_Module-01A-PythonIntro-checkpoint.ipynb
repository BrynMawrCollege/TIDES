Thus, it's sufficient to do those things just once in a notebook.  (One exception is the declaration of `matplotlib` as inline: if you do this somewhere other than the beginning of the notebook, it's possible that IPython will not know about it everywhere in the notebook.  Therefore, if you anticipate doing any plotting in a notebook it's a good idea to set up `matplotlib` in the first code cell, or not far below the first.)  The same comment applies to user-defined functions: once defined in a code cell that's been executed, user-defined functions are available elsewhere in the notebook."

    "Most IDEs, including Anaconda, as well as the IPython implementation in Jupyterhub, provide a debugger that will display the sequence of function calls associated with an error.  Remember that when you run code, you usually \"call\" standard Python functions or functions from various libraries; those, in turn, often call other functions, leading to a long chain of function calls associated with the running of your code.  When an error is reported to you, the sequence of function calls shown in Jupyterhub appears in order -- your code containing the source of the error will appear at the *bottom* of the sequence; above that will be any immediate function that called your code, and above that will be the earlier functions called in the chain of function calls.  So, to figure out what the original source of error is in your code, scroll to the *bottom* of the error message first."

    "As an example, consider the code below which defines a function `plot_sqrt` to plot the sqrt of `x` over the range 0 to 9.  If we look at the bottom of the output, we see the error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'plot'`.   The meaning of this message is not critical here, but note that it's arising in the line shown by the longer (lower) arrow, where our function calls the matplotlib library function `ax.plot(x, sqrt(x))`.  Above that section of the error message is another section containing a shorter arrow pointing to the line `plot_sqrt()` at the bottom of the cell, which is the line at the bottom of the cell where we called our function, which called `ax.plot(x, sqrt(x))`.  So, to recap, the error message shows us that the error itself was in the line `ax.plot(x, sqrt(x))`, but that line was called by the function `plot_sqrt()` that we created, so that sequence of function calls (first to `plot_sqrt`, then to `ax.plot`) is what the debugger gives us.  Generally, we care only about the last section of the message -- the location of the original error."

Formats also can use an additional number after a decimal point to specify the number of decimal places to print.  In other words, **`%N.nf`** prints a float with `N` total digits and `n` digits after the decimal (so `N` must be greater than `n`).  (Note: if the total number of digits to be printed exceeds the specified value `N`, then all of the digits before the decimal point will be printed, as will `n` of the digits after the decimal point.  If the number has fewer than `N` total digits, then extra spaces will be printed before the number.)  There are other formatting strings, but the ones presented here are the most common.\n",

For instance, in the first example the value `pi` replaces the `%d` characters, causing `pi` to be printed as an integer (which chops off the fractional part).   \n",

    "Whether or not a `while` loop is executed depends on whether the condition following the word \"`while`\" is met: if so, all of the *indented* code below the `while` line is executed; if not, execution passes to the first line of code below the indented block.  So, in the example above, the squares of the values `0, 1, 2,` and `3` are printed out, because those values satisfy the `while` \"`i < 4`\" condition; once `i` becomes `4` the condition is not met, so the indented code block is skipped and execution continues with the final `print` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `i` again is acting as the loop counter (any letter or symbol or string could be used; it doesn't have to be `i`, although it and `n` are commonly used).  Note that for a `while` loop you have to both *initialize* (give an initial value for) and *increment* (increase, at the end of the loop) the loop counter yourself, whereas as the next example below shows, the `for` loop doesn't actually need a counter, and so is more compact.  If you forget to increment the counter, the `while` loop will run in an infinite loop, forever evaluating its code for the first value of the counter.  **Make sure always to increment a `while` loop counter!**\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you forget to *initialize* the counter, it may be that nothing will happen, since the computer doesn't know the counter's value.  It might also give a result, but not what you might expect, since the computer might assume some \"random\" initial value for the counter.)  In both types of loop, every line in the block of indented code below the `for` or `while` is part of the loop.  When the loop ends, execution of the program continues with the first non-indented line below the loop.  (Other programming languages identify the body of a loop using syntax other than indentation, e.g., by enclosing it in braces { }.)"
