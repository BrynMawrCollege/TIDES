    "**Dr. Fred Begay** was born on the Ute Mountain Indian Reservation in Colorado in 1932.  At the age of 10 he was sent to a government-run school to learn farming; students there were forbidden from practicing the Navajo language and  culture, and were forced to speak English and attend a Christian church.  At age 18 (in 1951) he left to join the Air Force and fight in the Korean War.  Returning to the U.S. in 1955, he enrolled at the University of New Mexico, where his decision to study physics was \"just an accident.\"  He went on to earn a PhD in nuclear physics from the university in 1972, and subsequently joined the research staff of Los Alamos National Laboratory.  His research has focused on controlled thermonuclear fusion in plasmas, and on the use of lasers for heating such plasmas.   Begay credits his Navajo culture for allowing him to learn physics despite a very unusual school experience: \"I think the key point is that I learned to think abstractly and develop reasoning skills when I was growing up, learning about lasers and radiation in the Navajo language\" he says, \"That's all embedded in our religion.\"  Begay has participated in many outreach and education efforts to support the Native American community.

This more general context shows that in the earlier module it was important to make the time step ($dt$) small, so that higher-order terms (specifically, the second-derivative term associated with the acceleration) could be neglected.  It turns out, though, that while the error at each time step is $O(h^2)$, when summed over all of the time steps the total error becomes $O(h)$.  [This is because each step involves $O(h^2)$ error, and the number of steps needed to span a given range is inversely proportional to $h$, so the overall error is $O(h^2) \\times 1/h = O(h)$.]  Thus, Euler's method is not very accurate, and since a much more accurate and equally fast alternative exists, Euler's method is not used for ODEs (although it does turn out to be useful in the solution of *partial* differential equations).  We now turn to the more accurate method."

Often, however, this function is the output of another program and does not have an analytic form.  In any case, the method to be presented here is more convenient, has better accuracy, and does not require the computation of any derivatives.\n",

    "This wonderful alternative approach is known as the ***Runge-Kutta*** (RK) ***method***, after the two German mathematicians who developed it around 1900.  In fact, it really is a set of approaches of different orders, of which Euler's method is just the first-order approach.  The difference between Euler's method and the second-order RK (hereafter, \"RK2\") method is illustrated in Figure 1.  Euler's method starts from the value of the function at time $t$, $x(t)$, and extrapolates the slope at that time, $f(x,t)$, to predict the value $x(t + h)$.  The RK2 method instead uses the value of the slope at the *midpoint* $t + h/2$.  One can see from the figure that the midpoint slope does a much better job of predicting the later value of the function than the slope at the earlier time $t$ does.  The two methods do equally well for a function that's a straight line but, generally speaking, the superiority of the second-order method is greater the more curved the function is in the time interval $t \\rightarrow t + h$.

A different category involves applications in which we wish to solve a differential equation subject to specified values at *two* (or more)  points; e.g., at two different times or at two different locations. These are called ***boundary value*** (BV) ***problems***.  Because they involve matching multiple conditions, they generally are harder to solve than initial value problems."

    "A common technique for solving BV problems is known as the ***shooting method***, which uses a directed trial-and-error approach to find the initial condition that produces a solution that matches the specified boundary conditions.  As an example, we might want to determine the proper speed with which to toss a ball upward so that it returns to its launch height (set as $y = 0$) at a specified later time (call it $t_f$).  A simple guess of the speed is almost certain to lead to the ball's projected position being either too high or too low at the specified later time.  How, then, should the guess be modified to arrive at a better estimate for the speed?  Suppose we write the motion of the ball in the form $y = f(v)$, where $y$ is its height at time $t_f$ as a function of the launch speed $v$.  Then, if we want to find the $v$ such that $y = 0$ at $t_f$, we need to find the *root* of the motion function; i.e., we want to solve for the particular $v = v_*$ that satisfies $f(v_*) = 0$.  There are many approaches to root finding, including the binary search method described briefly (in a different context) in Module 2, so this represents a viable approach to solving this motion problem.  The solution involves two main steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Guess an initial speed $v$ and use an integrator, e.g. RK4, to compute the corresponding position of the ball at time $t_f$.  For a second-order differential equation, one needs to use the trick of section 10.2 to transform the equation into two first-order equations.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use a root-finding method that repeatedly calls the integrator, with a shrinking range of values for the initial speed, to identify the one that produces motion matching the boundary conditions."

    "**Example #1**  \n",
    "For the problem of the tossed ball discussed above, the differential equation of motion is $\\dfrac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g$, which can be written as the two first-order equations $z = \\dfrac{dy}{dt}$, $\\dfrac{dz}{dt} = -g$.  Below is code that will solve this problem (split up into four code cells that implement different parts of the computation).  After defining some constants, it creates a function to return the derivatives of $y$ and $z$---those are passed into a specialized RK4 function to compute the final height (at time $t_f$) of the ball for a given initial speed.  Subsequent code uses a binary search, a.k.a. ***bisection*** approach, which calls the RK4 function repeatedly with different initial speed values to compute the corresponding final heights of the ball, until it finds one that lies within a specified target range of zero height.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The bisection approach to finding a root of a function $F(x)$ starts with two \"limiting\" values of $x$, call them $a_1$ and $b_1$, that bound an interval known to contain the root.  (See Figure 2.  The root is shown as a big red dot.)  Such a choice of limiting values means that $F(x) < 0$ for one of them and $F(x) > 0$ for the other.  The $x$ value midway between the limiting values, $x_m = (x_1 + x_2)/2$, will become a new limiting value, replacing either $x_1$ or $x_2$---whichever produces an $F(x)$ value with the same sign as $F(x_m)$. [In the example shown in the figure, $b_2$ is the midway point between $a_1$ and $b_1$, and it replaces $b_1$ as a limiting point in the first iteration since $F(b_2)$ has the same sign as $F(b_1)$.]  The process continues until the range containing the root is as small as desired.  (The shrinking ranges are indicated by braces at the bottom of the figure.) "

    "As a specific example, consider a particle in an infinite potential well, with potential $V(x)$ inside the well (in the range $0 < x < L$), and $V(x) = \\infty$ elsewhere.  We know that the wavefunction $\\Psi(x)$ must vanish at $x = 0$ and $x = L$, where the potential becomes infinite.  Thinking about the tossed-ball example, we might imagine that matching the boundary conditions would require us to specify the derivative of the wavefunction, $d\\Psi/dx$ at $x = 0$ (analogous to the launch speed of the ball), but it turns out to be irrelevant.  To understand why, imagine that we set $\\Psi(0) = 0$ and assume some value for $d\\Psi(0)/dx$ that leads not to $\\Psi(L) = 0$, but to $\\Psi(L) = \\Delta$.  Since the Schrodinger equation is linear, changing $d\\Psi(0)/dx$ by some factor $a$ will change $\\Psi(L)$ to $a\\Delta$.  It won't be possible to force $\\Psi(L) = 0$ without setting $d\\Psi(0)/dx = 0$, which then would make $\\Psi(x) = 0$ everywhere.\n",

    "\n",
    "The code to solve this situation (see below) is similar in general form to that for Example #1, with some modifications.  In the `f(r,x,e)` function, the two variables bundled into the `r` vector are \"psi\" ($\\Psi$) and \"phi\" ($\\phi$).  The derivatives of $\\Psi$ and $\\phi$ used in the function correspond to the expressions in Eq.\\ (\\ref{wavefnderivs}).  In the `solve` function, $\\Psi(0)$ is set to `0.0` and, as discussed above, the initial value for $\\phi = d\\Psi/dx$ can be chosen arbitrary (as long as it's not $0$), so the code uses `1.0`.  This function uses RK4 to solve for $\\Psi$ at the given energy; even though we ultimately care only about $\\Psi$, both it and $\\phi$ have to be integrated simultaneously, since the former function depends on the latter.  The last section of code then uses the bisection approach to find the energy that makes $\\Psi(L) = 0$.  (Note that this isn't necessarily the best root-finding method in this situation.  Since the initial limiting values of $E$ used in the bisection method have to \"surround\" the true value, we have to have a sense of what that value is at the start.  If we want to find the ground-state energy, a better root-finding approach would be the ***secant method***, for which the two initial values do not have to surround the true value.  Thus, both could be chosen smaller than any ground state energy we might expect, and we wouldn't have to have a sense of that energy to begin with.)\n",
