    "**Margaret Hamilton** is one of pioneers in the field of computer programming.  She was born in 1936 in Indiana, where she received a B.A. in mathematics from Earlham College, a Quaker college.  She subsequently moved to Boston where she intended to pursue a graduate degree in math at Brandeis University.  However, in 1960 she took an interim position at MIT developing weather prediction software for Professor Edward Lorenz, the modern discoverer of chaos theory.  She later took a job at the Draper Laboratory of MIT, where she eventually became the director of software programming for the Apollo and Skylab programs.  Hamilton was especially instrumental in developing technology for landing spacecraft on the moon in the 1960s.  Hamilton essentially designed the first-ever software that landed people on the moon, for the Apollo 11 mission.  The software prevented disaster on the trip.  Three minutes before landing, the spacecraft’s computer was overloaded because it was trying to do too many  things.  But because of the program that Hamilton had written, it was able to prioritize its actions and ignore the ones not associated with the landing.  In creating the Apollo space mission software, Hamilton contributed to many subfields of computing.  She is credited with coining the term \"software engineering,\" and she helped to develop the techniques of asynchronous software, priority scheduling, and end-to-end testing, to name a few.  Hamilton’s work paved the way for the growth and development of new ideas and new fields in computational science.  And in the process, she took people to the moon!  (Some information taken from the Wikipedia page on Margaret Hamilton.)"

It implies that for a continuous function that is *not* bandwidth limited to a frequency lower than $f_c$, then the frequency components lying outside the range $-f_c < f < f_c$ are spuriously Fourier transformed into that range in a phenomenon known as ***aliasing***.  Figure 4 shows what can happen in such a situation: a high-frequency signal (solid sinusoidal wave) is sampled at a rate below its frequency, and the resulting signal appears to be of a lower frequency (dashed wave).  Unfortunately, there's not much that can be done to avoid aliasing, other than imposing a bandwidth limit on a signal and then sampling it at appropriately small intervals.\n"

    "(b) Modify the first DFT function so that it computes \\emph{all} of the `c[k]` coefficients, including those with $k > \\tfrac{1}{2} N$.  (The `numpy` function to compute a complex conjugate comes from the `numpy.ma` library and is called `conjugate`.) Run it and the vectorized version on the square wave data, and plot the two results (on separate graphs; as small dots, using '.').  To determine whether or not they're the same, plot the difference between them (on a third graph), and also use `numpy`'s `allclose` function, which returns `True` if corresponding elements of two arrays are the same to within some small tolerance.  (See the documentation for `numpy.allclose` for information on how to use it and on the default tolerances; other values may be provided by the user as arguments passed to the function).  Do the results agree with each other?  \n",

    "(c) Using `numpy`'s `linspace` function, create sine wave data in the range (0, $2\\pi$) using $1000$ data points, run your \"full\" or vectorized DFT function on it, and plot the first $10$ values.  Do the same for sine wave data in the range (0, $4\\pi$), again with $1000$ data points.  Explain the two graphs. }\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Finally, run `numpy`'s `fft` function (from the `numpy.fft` library) on your square wave and on the first sine wave of (c) to check whether its outputs are the same as those from our DFT functions.  \n",

    "To show the superior speed of `numpy`'s `fft` routine, apply it, the nonvectorized DFT routine you used in Exercise \\#2, and the vectorized DFT routine, to your square wave.  Time how long it takes each routine to perform the Fourier transform by using the `timeit` magic [e.g., `%timeit fft(square)`].  How do the times compare (pay attention to the units)?  \n",

    "Import the sound data in the file `piano.txt`, which you should find where the modules are posted.  You will need to upload it to the directory in which you are running your notebook, and then read it into a variable using the syntax `sound = numpy.loadtxt('piano.txt')`, where \"`sound`\" is the variable name.  (a) Plot the data in this file.  (b) Now run `numpy`'s `fft` routine on the data, storing the Fourier transform output and plotting it as well.  You should see two large spikes, as well as several small ones (all in a symmetric pattern).  (c) Copy the data from the Fourier transform output to a new array, and change that new array so that the data points in the range 2001-98000 have the value 0: this will eliminate most of the smaller spikes in the Fourier transform.  Plot the new array to confirm this.  (d) Apply the reverse transform `ifft` to this new array, and plot the result.  How does it compare to the original `piano` plot?  Explain any differences you observe.  (e) Run the notebook `Soundfile_Player.ipynb` from the directory where the modules are posted.  It will produce audio players that you can run to play the original sound file and the one with the small spikes eliminated.  How do they compare?  Explain any differences you hear.  How does this mesh with what you observed in the plots of those files?   \n"

    "A wave with period $T$ has a frequency $f = 1/T$.  For the Nyquist frequency to match that frequency, we require $1/T = 1/2\\Delta$, or $\\Delta = T/2$.  Thus, the wave must be sampled at half the period, or twice per cycle --- if it's sampled at one peak, it will be sampled at all of the other peaks and troughs.  By the way, this is why digital audio usually is sampled at around 44 Mhz or higher: this is a high enough sample rate to accurately detect sound frequencies of 22 Hz, which is at the upper limit of normal human hearing."
