    "As a first exercise, let's consider how we would find the largest element in a list of numbers.  To come up with an approach, it might help to think about how you would do this yourself, but it's important to keep in mind that humans are especially good at simultaneously analyzing (\"parallel processing\") small amounts of information.  (And sometimes large amounts of information, such as images.)  For example, we can look at a short list of numbers, say four or five of them, and instantly see which is largest.  But suppose we want to find the largest element in a list of 100 numbers... that most of us couldn't do with a quick glance.  Take a moment to think about how *you* would do it before continuing on.  (It's important to mention that the way a human would solve a problem isn't always the best way for a computer solve it, but it's often a good place to start.) "

In the previous method, there's really no point in comparing two list values to each other if neither of them is known to be the largest value.)

    " A somewhat more complicated task than just finding the smallest or largest value in a list is sorting it.  There are many algorithms that have been developed for this purpose; some of the best-known ones are called *bubble sort*, *merge sort*, *heapsort*, *quicksort*, and *insertion sort* (see the Wikipedia page on \"Sorting algorithm\" for other examples and more information.)  We'll consider the last of these -- insertion sort -- since the algorithm is easier to understand than most of the others.  (It is fairly efficient for small lists, but not for longer ones.  Algorithm efficiency is discussed in Module 2.)  Insertion sort is an example of an \"in-place\" sorting algorithm, as it reorders the original list rather than copying or moving the elements to a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again think of a numerical list (but it also could be a list of words that we wish to alphabetize) with its elements in a random order.  The basic idea behind insertion sort is to work through the list one element at a time (starting with the *second* one), comparing this \"current\" element to the previous ones, which have already been sorted, and inserting it in the proper place in the list if it's out of order.  Below is a simple example of what the algorithm would do for a small list, [1, 7, 5, 2, 4], in sorting the elements from smallest to largest.  The steps (explained after the figure) represent the form of the list after each \"current\" element has been analyzed:  \n",

    "$$\n",
    "$$ $$\n",
    "In the first step, the $7$ is the current element, and it's compared with the $1$; nothing happens since they are ordered correctly (smaller to larger), so the list isn't changed.  Next, the $5$ becomes the current element and it is compared to the $7$; because they're out of order the two must be interchanged, but since the $5$ is bigger than the $1$ they're not swapped, so at this point we have the sequence [$1, 5, 7, 2, 4$].  Next, the new current element $2$ is compared with the $7$, and since it's smaller they have to be swapped.  Then the $2$ is compared with the $5$, and those two also have to be swapped; since the $2$ is larger than the $1$, those two are not swapped, and so we have the sequence [$1, 2, 5, 7, 4$].  Finally, the current element $4$ is compared with the $7$; since it's smaller, those two must be swapped, but the $4$ also is smaller than the $5$, so those are swapped too.  The $4$ is greater than $2$, so they're not swapped, and now all original elements have been analyzed and the list is in order."

It would immediately pass to the `else` statement, where it would return `3*fact(2)`, but it doesn't have anything to return yet because it has to execute the call of `fact(2)`.  In doing this, it would enter the function again, pass to the `else` statement, and return `2*fact(1)`.  It still has no value to return, so it makes the last call to `fact`, which would return `1` from the base case.  Thus, in the end, the function returns `3*fact(2) = 3*2*fact(1) = 3*2*1`, as we want.  Note that if the code didn't include the base case, then the function would keep calling itself indefinitely, with `n = 0, -1, -2, ... .`"
