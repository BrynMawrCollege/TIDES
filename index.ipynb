    "These modules, developed under a grant from the TIDES (Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in\n",
    "STEM) project of the Association of American Colleges & Universities, are designed to teach the\n",

    "Python programming language. It is hoped that the set of modules will work as a largely independent\n",
    "learning experience in basic programming skills for science students; of course, the set also could serve\n",
    "as the core content or a supplement to the main content of a formal course. In fact, they were tested out\n",
    "on and refined with feedback from students who used them in a formal computational methods course\n",
    "(PHYS 350) offered at Bryn Mawr in the spring of 2015. (That course was run essentially as a\n",
    "computational lab: students were asked to do readings in the modules ahead of class time, and they\n",
    "worked on the embedded exercises during class. Lecturing was kept to a very bare minimum.)\n",
    "A secondary goal of the set of modules is to attract to computing and computational science students\n",
    "from groups typically underrepresented in those fields. One approach to that goal is to give students an\n",
    "appreciation of the wide range of individuals who have contributed to the development of\n",

    "implemented in each module by the inclusion of a scientist profile, most of which were developed by\n",
    "the students in PHYS 350. A second approach, which was employed at regular intervals in that course,\n",
    "was to ask students a \"reflection question\" meant to encourage them to think about how science and\n",
    "computation was relevant to them and could serve their personal goals. We asked the students in the\n",
